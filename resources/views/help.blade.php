                    <p><b>Hanzai</b> is a classic browser-based, text-driven MMORPG set in Japan and the corresponding organized-crime world. Players take on the role of an aspiring criminal and work their way up the ranks of the underworld through strategy, risk-taking, and social interaction.</p>
<br/>
<p>The game is entirely text-based, meaning gameplay revolves around menus, timers, and written descriptions rather than graphics. You start as a low-level criminal and perform crimes such as theft or carjacking to earn money, experience, and reputation. As you progress, you unlock higher ranks, gaining more influence and access to more lucrative (and dangerous) activities.</p>
<br/>
<p>A major part of <b>Hanzai</b> is its multiplayer and social aspect. Players can join or create gangs/yakuza, cooperate on organized crimes, compete with rival gangs and fight over prefectures / territories. Trust, diplomacy, and betrayal all play a role, and communication (often through in-game messages) is the key to success.</p>
<br/>

<p>So what are you waiting for? Get out there and earn some money.</p>
